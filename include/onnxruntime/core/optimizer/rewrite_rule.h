/**
@class RewriteRule 

The base class for a rewrite rule. A rewrite rule represents a semantics-preserving
transformation of a computation graph. It can be used to represent, for example,
the elimination of operators that serve as no-ops (e.g., dropout during
inference), as well as inlining of "function" definitions or the dual (replacing
a complex expression by an equivalent function-call). Unlike the more general
IGraphTransformer, a rewrite rule is applied at a single node, representing the
root of an expression that is rewritten.

When creating a new rewrite rule, two main function have to be implemented: SatisfyCondition and Apply.
- SatisfyCondition determines whether the rule will be triggered, and can include multiple condition checks.
It is advisable to add the more selective checks first, because those will lead to discarding fast rules that 
cannot be applied on a node.
- Apply is the actual body of the rule that will be executed if the checks in SatisfyCondition are passed
successfully. Note that additional, more complex checks can be included in the Apply if putting them in the
SatisfyCondition would lead to duplicate work (e.g., when we make a check on a Node attribute but we need
that attribute to execute the rule too).

In general, simple fast checks are a better fit for SatisfyCondition, whereas more complex ones can be 
added in the Apply.
